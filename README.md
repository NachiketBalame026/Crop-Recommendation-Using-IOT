### About the Hardware Setup
This image illustrates the hardware setup for the **Crop Recommendation Using IoT** project. The setup includes:
- **IoT Sensors**: Used for collecting real-time data such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
- **Microcontroller**: Responsible for processing sensor data and transmitting it to the server.
- **Power Supply**: Ensures uninterrupted operation of the sensors and the microcontroller.
- **Connectivity Module**: Enables wireless data transmission to the cloud for analysis.

The hardware is designed to be robust, energy-efficient, and scalable for various agricultural environments.

### About the Output
This image showcases the **Crop Recommendation Output** generated by our system. Based on the input data from IoT sensors, the application processes the following parameters:
- **Soil Moisture**: Measured in real-time to determine soil conditions.
- **Temperature and Humidity**: Critical factors influencing crop growth.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Predict the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

The output highlights:
- **Recommended Crop**: The suggested crop based on current environmental factors.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Ensures that farmers receive accurate and actionable recommendations to maximize yield and resource efficiency.
