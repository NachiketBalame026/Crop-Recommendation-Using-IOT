### About the Hardware Setup
This image illustrates the hardware setup for the **Crop Recommendation Using IoT** project. The setup includes:
- **IoT Sensors**: Used for collecting real-time data such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
- **Microcontroller**: Responsible for processing sensor data and transmitting it to the server.
- **Power Supply**: Ensures uninterrupted operation of the sensors and the microcontroller.
- **Connectivity Module**: Enables wireless data transmission to the cloud for analysis.

The hardware is designed to be robust, energy-efficient, and scalable for various agricultural environments.
